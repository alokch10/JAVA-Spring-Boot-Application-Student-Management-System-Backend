# Student Management System - Backend Application

This backend application is designed to manage student information for college administrators. It offers functionalities such as registering new student records, updating existing records, deleting records, and retrieving student information. The technologies used in this project include Core Java, Spring Boot, REST API, REST WebServices, and MongoDB.

## Features

1. **Information Retrieval**: Retrieve detailed information about students stored in the system.
2. **Information Updating**: Update existing student records with the latest information.
3. **Create New Student Records**: Register new students by creating records in the system.
4. **Delete Record**: Remove student records from the database when needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Core Java**: The foundation of the application, providing robust and efficient backend functionality.
- **Spring Boot**: Simplifies the development of production-ready applications with its convention over configuration approach.
- **REST API**: Utilized for building scalable and loosely coupled systems, allowing communication between different components.
- **REST WebServices**: Enables communication and interaction between the frontend and backend components through HTTP protocols.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store and manage student records in a flexible and scalable manner.

## Testing Tool

- **Postman**: Employed for testing and validating the functionality of the RESTful APIs.
